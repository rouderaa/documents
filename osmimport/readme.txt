First run the minibiebs project that generates the minibiebs.xml file.
Copy this file to this project.

Then run this project that merges the favourites_org.xml file with the contents of the minibiebs.xml file and
sorts the resulting favourites.xml file by name.

Rename the favourites.xml file to favourites.gpx and then copy it to your iphone using iTunes.
